# What I have done and what's my plan next

#### What I have done?

1. I have learned some basic knowledge about NLP、transformers、models about SOTA summarizing models.

2. think about how to get dataset and wrote a program to catch news from different news website.
3. create some ordinary models used for summarizing, waiting for trained.

#### My plan next

1. get a dataset contains 3 months of news for training. Preprocess the data.
2. Improve my crawling program to crawl news every day and provide it to users.
3. Train and test three summarization models, evaluate and select one to summarize text.

4. something to complete the function.
